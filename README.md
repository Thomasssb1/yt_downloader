# YT Downloader
Annoyed at how hard it has become to just download a youtube video? Online solutions don't work as expected or are full of ads? This repo offers an easy to use command line script which downloads a youtube video to your local device without any extra steps. <br>
This uses an implementation of [youtube_explode_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_explode_dart) to mostly make this happen, as well as [args](https://pub.dev/packages/args) for the command line interface.

## Implementation
To get started, just download one of the [releases](https://github.com/Thomasssb1/yt_downloader/releases#latest) which includes a precompiled executable - so you do not need to have dart or any of the libraries to run this.
